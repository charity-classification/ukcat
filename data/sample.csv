We understand that elderly people can get lonely and our volunteers spend between 10-30 minutes with them each evening chatting. The group goes out between the hours of 7-9pm each night and run a 24/7 helpline for anyone who we can assist.

With the advent of the internet the Foundation was able to make digitised sources, including online databases of over 2 million records, more readily available to the general public and our network of contacts. Complementing this approach the Foundation is bringing its expertise to local communities through outreach and educational initiatives. It has built on community based family and history workshops to deliver a range of courses, classes, summer schools and heritage projects in partnership with voluntary organisations, community interface groups, colleges, universities, cross-community and cross-border bodies and local councils.

The Club works in co-operation with the PSNI and Magherafelt Community Safety to help fund activities such as intergenerational activities, dance, beauty, life skills, fitness, discos, football tournaments, leadership, positive health & well being, self confidence and self esteem. These activities are broken down into specific programmes and young people are encouraged to participate in the Presidents Award which is a ten month programme encouraging confidence and self esteem. In the last year 45 young people completed this award. The club also makes links with other local clubs developing relationships and learning about other people's points of view. The club provides a safe secure environment where all activities are supervised by a group of enthusiastic qualified leaders and mentors. The group tends to pay close attention to local issues. Draperstown has an unfortunate record of mental illness so the club had a dedicated programme of talks, meetings and activities focusing on these issues.

USPCA is supported entirely by voluntary donations. The USPCA’s business model changed dramatically on the 1st April 2012 as a result of the implementation of the new Welfare of Animals Act (NI) which placed a statutory responsibility on Local Authorities to improve welfare standards and afford better protection from neglect, abuse and exploitation for companion animals and livestock. In response the USPCA has moved away from traditional animal recovery and sheltering practices to the provision of an Animal Hospital for the ‘Relief of Suffering’ and associated charitable services. The Hospital treats many injured animals that would otherwise remain untreated and in distress. It also ensures that essential veterinary care is available for companion animals where the pet owners’ financial circumstances are an obstacle to their animal’s wellbeing. Outreach from the Animal Hospital, to provide these services to those in need across Northern Ireland, is achieved through a voucher scheme for local Vets. In partnership with the Trussell Trust and other organisations, who operate food banks across Northern Ireland, the USPCA provides food parcels for the many companion animals belonging to individuals and families in need, thereby supporting the animals’ welfare and ensuring their continued companionship for the owners. The USPCA also investigates and exposes animal cruelty such as organised dog fighting, badger baiting, carted deer hunts or cock fighting. Through its education programmes for schools and community associations the USPCA promotes responsible pet care and instils an appreciation for our native wildlife.","The objects of the Ulster Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals are: 1. The advancement of animal welfare. 2. To obtain justice for animals and to endeavour by every legitimate means to put an end to cruelty to animals and to encourage kindness and humanity in their treatment. 3.

The issues we have campaigned on include housing, homelessness, mental health unemployment, urban regeneration, education, domestic violence and the right to play.

Careful consideration is given to the accessibility of the theatre to ensure that it is accessible for all, including those from disadvantaged areas and those requiring assistance to attend the theatre. We have an “Access for All Scheme” which includes assisted and relaxed performances and provide circa 3,000 complimentary companion seats to those who require essential assistance to encourage customers with a disability to attend the theatre. In addition to the education of audiences through high quality theatrical performances Grand Opera House Trust provides education and outreach programmes involving schools, community groups and individuals, including workshops, professional classes, talks/seminars and demonstrations. Through its education and outreach programmes the Trust extends the range and reach of its work, often working with disadvantaged communities, and nurtures new talent and skills via participation in our outreach programmes e.g. the Summer Youth Project. The Grand Opera House is an historic listed building. The historic nature of the 1895 Frank Matcham theatre plays an important role in the educational aspect of our work via the promotion of the history and heritage of the theatre and its important role in the life of the city.","The Grand Opera House Trust is established to promote, maintain, improve and advance the education of the public of Northern Ireland in the arts (including the art of drama, operatic arts, other performing arts and the visual arts) at the Grand Opera House, Belfast.",CCNI,9738796.0,8454187.0,2019-03-31,01_over_100000,http://www.goh.co.uk,28078,AR-03-05;AR-03-03;AR-03-00;AR-03-07;BE-01-15;SW-01-05;AR-03-02;EC-01-01,A11
