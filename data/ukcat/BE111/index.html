Our activities will aid in complementing existing service provision and aid in supporting multi-organisational approaches to community development.  (b) the advancement of the arts, heritage, culture or science by providing a platform for organisations involved in the arts, heritage, culture and sciences to be able to meet with and build the capacity of ethnic minority community members (as well as members of the wider community), who have traditionally been underrepresented in these areas, in a setting that is culturally sensitive to their needs and is also easily identifiable within the community and has strong transportation links.  (c) the provision of recreational facilities, or the organisation of recreational activities, with the object of improving the conditions of life for the persons for whom the facilities or activities are primarily intended by providing a platform for ethnic minority community members (as well as the wider community) to encourage participation. We will deliver activities that have been requested from members our community via our community consultations so that that a people-led approach is being taken at all times.</td>
