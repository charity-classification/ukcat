<td><strong>TTBS Juniors</strong> [Charity number: <a href="https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-102961">NI102961</a>]<br>TTBS Juniors primarily runs soccer coaching sessions in two venues (GAPS Sports, Centrepoint and Lurgan Junior High) from Monday to Friday each week, with 8 affiliated teams provided for and playing within the local Mid-Ulster and Lisburn Leagues each Saturday. These sessions during the week are open to children and young people from Northern Ireland to take part; however we mainly attract the majority of participants from the Craigavon BC area. All sessions are taken by volunteers and mainly focus on developing fundamental movement skills of children and young people as they grow older. We intermittently cater 140 children between the ages 3-14 years old. We also organise educational workshops encouraging positive mental health at a number of venues in conjunction with local services such as PSNI and PIPS Upper Bann. These are very important to the ethos of our charity, since they are vital in our local area with various abuses so prevalent. We also provide positive mental health speakers to local schools/ community groups, encouraging vision and focus within education and have also provided speakers nationally. The core services of the charity include the aforementioned activities, however the charity is still growing and we are aiming to run season events for children and young people, such as Halloween camps, summer schemes and intervention programmes. These intervention programmes will be aimed at teenagers. Train to be Smart Juniors creates an outlet for the local community, encouraging parents and our volunteer to improve their skills and knowledge through qualifications and workshops. In this area of Lurgan/Craigavon, with increased alcohol, drugs and social media abuse leading to self harm and suicide, TTBS juniors engages with local groups and schools to promote education of signs and symptoms of anxiety/depression, and to emphasise the importance of sport as a medium to encourage positive mental health within our local community.</td>

Programmes include residentials, group sessions and one to one work. Volunteering is actively promoted. Link Addiction Support Services (MARC Project)- Supporting those with addiction problems to reduce self harm, promote sobriety and maintain independence. The unrestricted access of the drop-in allows for conversation, showers, clean clothes and hot food. Housing support helps with maintaining tenancies, developing skills for independent living and hospital and prison visiting. Programmes of daily activities encourage sobriety and rehabilitation. Senior Citizens lunch club- Run by Senior Citizen volunteers for other Senior Citizens, a healthy lunch and good craic is provided on Monday each week. Lifts are also available. Tots Time @ The Link - provides children and their carers with an easily accessed community venue where children can learn through educationally stimulating play. By focusing on individual needs, children of all abilities can learn to share and care for each other while their carers find friendship and support. English Language Classes - The Link currently provides English classes, free of charge for members of the local ethnic minority community. Volunteer teachers work with both adults and their children in a welcoming and supportive environment each Monday night.</td>
