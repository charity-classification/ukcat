<strong>Brantwood Military Heritage Association</strong> [Charity number: [NI104754](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-104754)]<br>In an unofficial capacity members of BMHA have been together since 2007. The Somme plays a significant part in the Protestant history of Northern Ireland as a key part of the battle was led by Regiments formed largely from the Protestant Communities in the nine counties of Ulster. A wish to explore and further understand these events, both military and political, led to the formal setting up of the Association which, in turn, attracted more members. The Association is now made up of twenty four members from different social standings within the Protestant Community in North Belfast who wish to explore the exploits of those Irish Divisions who fought in the Two World Wars. The learning outcome of these trips for many of the group was not just the loss of life and the sacrifice of so many from the Island of Ireland but the realisation that the story of the Somme and other conflicts cannot just be looked at from a local perspective, there also has to be a regional and international content to any discussion. This experience caused members of the Association to realise and reflect that their experience and view of the First and Second World Wars might be completely different from those with different cultural traditions and values. This reflection has successfully been the catalyst for the Association to not only engage with other groups who have similar objectives but to also engage and network with members of the Catholic Community in North Belfast and across the border. These discussions provided the opportunity to not only reflect on the individual and collective experiences of communities in regards to how they acknowledge and remember all of those on the Island of Ireland who died in the First and Second World Wars but to examine with ‘others’ the historical content of the lead up to the First World War and how out of an act of unity came division. | £1,080
