<strong>Healing Through Remembering</strong> [Charity number: [NI101717](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-101717)]<br>Healing Through Remembering (HTR) is an extensive cross-community project made up of a range of individual members holding differing political, social and religious perspectives who come together to focus on the issue of how best to deal with the past relating to the conflict in and about Northern Ireland. Through on-going internal discussions, research, roundtable discussions, conferences and outreach programmes, HTR produces a range of reports, options papers, exhibitions, dramas, discussion papers, events and audits which continue to inform discussion throughout society – this includes community groups, political parties, statutory and government policy makers. HTR’s key strength lies in its diverse membership who come from a range of backgrounds – including loyalist, republican, British Army, police, church, media, victims, academia and community activism - who work together on how best to deal with the past relating to the conflict. Thus HTR addresses issues with the full range of views and opinions as part of the debate. HTR’s success relies on an inclusive and bottom-up approach which facilitates the development of innovative mechanisms and best practices. Vital to the work of HTR is the building of trust so as to form a safe space in which dialogue can be open and honest. The work of HTR addresses five particular themes, each one identified following a public consultation in 2002. These are Storytelling, Day of Reflection, Truth Recovery & Acknowledgement, Living Memorial Museum and Commemoration. Membership consists of individuals who hold very different views and perspectives on the themes they are discussing, but who agree on the need to create a better future. Examples of work done include an Annual Day of Reflection on 21 June every year since 2007, an exhibition entitled ‘Everyday Objects transformed by the Conflict’ and the report ‘Are we there yet?’ a document outlining proposals in regard to dealing with the past. | £68,867
