<strong>Bangor-Pl û Polish Association In County Down</strong> [Charity number: [NI103543](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-103543)]<br>Polish Association constitutional objectives are realised through our program of activities which benefit in every way not only the Polish Community within the area but also other minor ethnic communities as well as local communities. We dedicate our activities mainly into education, integration, democracy, tolerance and human rights in particular human rights for ethnic minorities. Our Polish Saturday School organized and run by the Polish Association in Bangor benefits Polish children giving them a chance to learn polish language, history and polish tradition while leaving abroad. However, apart from teaching polish language at PS school we are working hard to integrate polish children with the local community. As an example Polish children took part in celebration of the commemoration service in memory of soldiers who lost their lives during the WW2. After the ceremony we have been invited to the parish hall for refreshment where we could meet local people and representative of local authorities to discuss the involvement of polish pilots during the war in the region. This is one example of our integration activities which the local community clearly benefits from. Every year in December our Polish Association organize a Christmas Festival event open to general public where we present polish culture, food and tradition related to celebration of the Christmas time back home. And every year this event gets bigger and better with a wide verity of people coming from a spectrum of local communities and local authorities to celebrate together with us and to integrate. We have people of many nationalities, different religions, backgrounds, material and social status, age, sex and colour of skin. We find our events to be very beneficial for the local communities in a process of community integration via learning of each other custom and playing together. | £12,480
