<strong>Esc Films</strong> [Charity number: [NI102123](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-102123)]<br>ESC is an award-winning culture and arts education charity working with storytelling, drama and film in Northern Ireland. Our Vision: To create radical transformation among those most disadvantaged by society. Our Mission: To use drama and film to change lives, challenge perceptions, tackle social exclusion, stigma and discrimination. HOW IT WORKS: ESC reacts to the changing environment around it in NI. It is project-driven and responsive to need. Over the past 15 years ESC has grown from a community arts organisation working primarily in drama with young disadvantaged people, often on cross-community interfaces within Belfast into film-making with a wide range of marginalized and disadvantaged individuals. We produced a world first award-winning film, Mickey B, a modern adaptation of Shakespeare’s Macbeth made within NI’s maximum security prison, with prisoners as cast. This has now been translated into seven languages. We have maintained a strong focus on criminal justice and on mental health within our short film projects all of which are based around therapeutic and educational elements. ESC provides educational qualifications (ASDAN Expressive Arts and Community Volunteering awards) and both creative and therapeutic engagement to extremely disadvantaged and/or socially excluded people, in particular those who fall through the gaps in service provision within criminal justice and mental health. ESC values first-hand experience. It is non-judgmental and practices honesty, respect, trust and openness. ESC provides opportunities for disadvantaged or socially-excluded people to experience creative interventions through drama and film. The overall aim of the organisation is to encourage marginalised people to understand and transform their lives by turning their unique experiences into films and documentaries. We do this across a wide range of short film-making projects. | £90,756
