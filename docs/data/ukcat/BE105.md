<strong>Focus: The Identity Trust</strong> [Charity number: [NI100557](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-100557)]<br>FOCUS's core work is providing peer support to Transgender and Intersex individuals and their families. The Trust helps ease the sense of isolation universally experienced by these people by providing a meeting place where experiences can be shared, permits individuals to talk about the difficulties of Transition to the acquired gender, offers help and advice on practical issues such as name change, documentation, how to deal with family relationships and offers a listening ear in a safe, confidential and welcoming environment. Traditionally, Transgender and Intersex individuals have been marginalised and discriminated against by mainstream society in education, housing, employment and healthcare . This has often been fuelled by ignorance of our conditions. To redress this there is a clear need for research into our conditions, their causes, incidence and how we are treated. In addition there is a need for education and training at all levels of society on our conditions and how they affect us and our families. To facilitate this the Trust offers information, education and training to Government, its Agencies and Private Sector Employers to demystify the issues, dispel myths and promote understanding in order to ultimately eradicate Transphobia and promote acceptance of Intersex individuals. At present even though Transgender and Intersex individuals are generally successful in education and their careers prior to Transition they are more likely to be in poorly paid or voluntary work post- Transition. They often suffer from mental health issues and physical ill-health due to the stresses of living with their condition. The Trust provides support and guidance which helps disapate these effects to the extent that they often disappear completely once the Transition process has been completed. By offering its services the Trust enables Transgender and Intersex individuals to contribute to society to their maximium potential and cease being a drain on scarce resources. | £3,312
