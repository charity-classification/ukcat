<strong>Newry Rainbow Community</strong> [Charity number: [NI101084](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-101084)]<br>The NRC has been very proactive in identifying and addressing the needs of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (lgb&t) people in Newry and surrounding areas. We have lobbied and advocated on behalf of lgb&t people locally and regionally. From September 2010 the NRC has operated a dedicated support Centre, run entirely by Volunteers, in Newry City to provide drop-in, information and advice services to lgb&t people and their families and friends. It is the only such Centre outside Belfast and Dublin on the East Coast of Ireland. Services and support provided include; personal development courses; advocacy and referrals; signposting; befriending service; professional counselling; rapid HIV testing; sexual health advice; a Women’s Group and a Youth Group. The NRC has worked to build relationships both within the lgb&t community and between the lgb&t community and wider society through lobbying, advocacy, awareness-raising activities and the development of social and networking opportunities for lgb&t people. This culminated in the first ever Pride In Newry festival and parade in September 2012 which witnessed very strong visible support and participation by the wider civic, political and community sectors of Newry and which developed a range of new volunteering opportunities. This major new festival enables the NRC to increase the visibility of the NRC as an organisation and to portray lgb&t people in a positive way, breaking down barriers and stereotypes and promoting community cohesion and the integration and participation of lgb&t people in all aspects of the wider community and civic life of Newry. The fact that Newry City was seen as a tolerant, safe place where a Pride parade and festival could be hosted was a significant factor in the achievement of Purple Flag status for Newry City Centre. | £14,779
