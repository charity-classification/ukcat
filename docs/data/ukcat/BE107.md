<strong>CAIRDE Teo</strong> [Charity number: [NI100120](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-100120)]<br>CAIRDE Teo is a community based limited company that aims to ameliorate conditions related to social and economic marginalisation through a combination of employment creation, training and learning opportunities, welfare advisory services and social enterprise initiatives. The community in which we are based is located in Armagh city west. The area suffers from a variety of social problems common to many disadvantaged areas throughout Ireland. Few job opportunities, poor educational attainment, ill health and high levels of economic inactivity are exacerbated by dereliction of the local environment and resignation and apathy among many. We have established a framework with which to address some of these problems. The services provided by our project are available to the entire community including members of newer migrant communities who now form an integral part of the social fabric of life in Armagh. In addition to our focus on education, training, migrant worker outreach initiatives and community development, the project has identified a number of gaps in the commercial market for a range of products and services. The company seeks to employ the skills of people and organisations within the local community by providing work and training opportunities. The company also provides opportunities for training and employment for adults with additional linguistic and cultural skills in Irish and other languages. Our project is recognised by the Revenue Commission as a charity for tax purposes. It was established by individuals who were concerned about the long term impact of poverty and social injustice on specific sectors of our community here and elsewhere throughout the country. Consultations resulted in the formation in 2009 of a steering group comprised of community activists, trade union activists, migrant workers representatives, Irish language and cultural activists and welfare and rights advisers. | £101,758
