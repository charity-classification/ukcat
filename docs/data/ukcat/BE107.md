As a result of participation in the programme, the Courthouse has been kept off the open market by its owners, the Dept of Justice (DoJ), until a proposal has been put forward by BSS. The group will present the findings of an Feasibility Study, to the DSD and DoJ in 2015. This study examines the long term restoration of the building and its sustainability, with BSS visioning the project as a catalyst in transforming the seafront of Bangor. It has ambitious plans in seeing the project become an internationally recognised centre for arts and cultural activities, with the hope of creating an attractive and compelling visitor destination in Bangor. In parallel, in pursuit of its stated purpose, BSS is drawing up a programme of community events that seek to increase and develop local public engagement in the visual and participatory arts, developing local engagement beyond attendance and towards active forms of involvement and co-production through three consecutive and overlapping, socially engaged public art projects:- Project 1 – will make visible the presence of BSS in an arts capacity within the local community of the town. This project will use local groups and individuals to produce a big visual impact around the courthouse building. Project 2 - will engage a variety of groups within the community, such as schools, young offenders, local older people, migrant communities, in a heritage based longer term visual arts project resulting in a large public event/exhibition. Project 3 – will commission a large scale public art work. This would once again make a visual statement about the building and will include an element of public engagement in its production. | £52
