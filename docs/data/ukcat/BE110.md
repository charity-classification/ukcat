Needless to say this respite service is in constant use. The Family & Friends of Hanna Street is a small local charity which engages in fund raising to help enrich the residents daily lives and this has become even more necessary given the cutbacks everyone has experienced over the past few years. The fund raising activities consist mainly of bag packing in local supermarkets, coffee mornings and ballots and some of the things we have provided for the residents in the past are: - music therapy sessions, outings to various places of local interest, paying for carers to support residents when they go on holidays (they cannot go on their own), Christmas decorations, a large screen TV, specially adapted computers (reconditioned) and last year we turned a piece of waste ground just outside the home into a small garden and courtyard where the residents can enjoy the spring/summer/autumn sun – when we get it! As the title suggests the people who engage in fund raising are all family or friends of the residents | £220
