We are targeting people within this area who cannot find support elsewhere and have little to no household income. We are trying to alleviate poverty by providing food rations including all relevant ingredients to feed the family between 10-30 days. We continue providing rations as well as helping to find employment for the individuals until they can afford their own meals. We are targeting people through local media, local food shops and Imam/scholar of the local mosque. We then investigate through channels such as food shops and shopkeepers in the area who know the people or families who cannot afford the food and buy their food on credit which they are unable to pay back. The shopkeepers then refer them to us. b) The advancement of education We are providing primary education to the local children within our own institution who cannot afford school fees, uniforms and travel expenses. Our main target is those children who are being forced into employment at very young ages due to poor families and therefore miss out on their education. We target the children working in local canteens, car and bike repair shops and local shops. Primary education is provided from a wide range of qualified volunteers from schools and colleges in surrounding areas. We provide scholarships if they want to continue education after graduating from our institution. In addition to education, we also provide sewing skills training for poor young girls in our learning centre as sewing is a big market in Pakistan which will allow them to find a job or work from home, while feeding their families. When they complete their course, we then donate them a sewing machine to get started. We provide food and accommodation to all those studying with us. c) The advancement of religion In our institution we provide Islamic education to poor children by teaching them the Qur'an (holy book or Islam) as well as prayers and other basic Islamic knowledge and principals.
