<strong>Invisible Traffick Ni</strong> [Charity number: [NI104713](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-104713)]<br>Invisible Traffick is involved in raising public awareness of the signs and indicators of Human Trafficking which is Modern Day Slavery. In order to help, protect and educate children, the charity has developed an Education Pack for Key Stage 1+2 Primary School children, which has been successfully distributed to over 300 primary schools in Northern Ireland. This Education Pack not only helps children learn about Modern Day Slavery using a child sensitive approach but it will also encourage teachers and parents to become equally as aware of this immoral act. The information in the pack works alongside the Northern Ireland Curriculum, and was developed by a principal of a primary school. It is also available in the Irish Language for distribution to north and south of Ireland as a cross community initiative. We also seek to prevent young and vulnerable adults from being coerced into this industry by alerting them to the signs and indicators used by traffickers. We are engaging in presentations to work with these young people so they are fully cognisant of the perils of Human Trafficking. The identification of victims of human trafficking is reported to be significantly low here in Northern Ireland and in the Republic of Ireland as well. In recognition of this need, we have developed and implemented an extensive training programme, aiding volunteers to work on the Support Helpline. At present we have 13 volunteers who are currently operating the helpline, with a further 9 waiting on the next training course. This is designed not only to identify victims of trafficking but also to assist others to report suspicious activity. This essential service was launched in March 2017. Our long term goal is to provide a safe environment for rescued victims of human trafficking, to offer care and support, to supply their needs, and inevitably to help them rebuild their lives. This will be an extensive process but an extremely worthwhile. | £40,684
