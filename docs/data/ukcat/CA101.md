<strong>Street Safe Ardglass Group</strong> [Charity number: [NI100042](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-100042)]<br>Our organisation, Street Safe, is a community safety project which revolves around three key objectives. Firstly to give young people a role and direction and help steer them away from alcohol, drugs and anti-social behaviour. Secondly we enable the older recipients of the service to feel safe, comfortable and aware of all the benefits and facilities available to them. Lastly we aim to enhance the Ardglass community as a safe, comfortable and progressive place to live where people are proud of their community and culture is promoted. The Street Safe group is completely unique as we are an organisation almost completely ran by the local youth of the area. On a daily scale, our young volunteers visit the homes of elderly residents of the local village and ensure that they have all doors and windows locked, they are warm enough and that they feel comfortable. We understand that elderly people can get lonely and our volunteers spend between 10-30 minutes with them each evening chatting. The group goes out between the hours of 7-9pm each night and run a 24/7 helpline for anyone who we can assist. On a more general scale, we help provide an alternative to destructive, anti-social behaviour by offering a volunteering opportunity for young people that helps them build on skills and gain qualifications whilst helping develop their community. We have provided the opportunity for young people to learn about the dangers of alcohol and drugs and take part in a vulnerable adults course. We hope that once the group is more developed, we will have the funds to stage events in the area promoting village pride, local culture and local heritage. We are currently working on projects that promote the rich history of the local fishing industry and possibly introducing the option for local residents to take Irish language classes. |
