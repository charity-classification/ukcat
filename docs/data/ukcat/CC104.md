<strong>Glenravel Community Development Association</strong> [Charity number: [NI106068](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-106068)]<br>GCDA was formally established in June 2006, to promote community development in the Glenravel area & to improve the quality of life for local residents. Our first key target was the development of a new Sport & Community Complex. In October 2009, that goal was achieved with the opening of a £1.7 million state-of-the-art facility which encompassed sports & leisure facilities, a multi-purpose social area & a community playgroup. The committee for the GCDA is made up of 7 people who are representative of the local community & the various user groups involved in the use of the facilities. It is testament to the efficient operation of the complex, & to the officers involved, that these are the same 7 individuals who were involved in the initial concept design for the proposed complex back in 2002. The main function of the GCDA is the day-to-day operation of the Sports & Community Complex. The organisation is run by volunteers who serve their community. Whilst generous financial assistance was obtained towards the capital cost of construction of the new complex, no funding support is received towards the operational or programme costs. There is a very strong level of community support towards the committee & “community ownership” for the successful operation of the complex. In early 2010, the GCDA joined the Ballymena East Rural Cluster Group (BERCC). We have joined this group to learn from the experiences of other communities & community groups, to extend our boundaries & to further improve the health & well-being of the local community in Glenravel. Examples of the activities undertaken include:- • Operating a 100m2 fitness studio with membership open to all, attracting 250 registered members. • Engaging 1 full time Fitness Development Officer & a panel of 20 volunteer staff to operate the fitness studio & complex. • Liaising with 12 'partner' organisations in developing their activities. | £112,960
