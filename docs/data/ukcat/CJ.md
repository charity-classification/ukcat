<strong>No More Traffik</strong> [Charity number: [NI100755](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-100755)]<br>NO MORE TRAFFIK exists to educate, activate and connect people across Northern Ireland in their response to human trafficking. Human trafficking is the deception, movement and exploitation of human beings for profit and is currently the fastest growing form of organised crime. Raising awareness of the issue and equipping people to respond is a crucial part of our work. We believe that awareness leads to action and action leads to change. As well as running regular awareness sessions in schools, youth projects, churches and community groups, we provide tailored training for front line sectors identified as being key in addressing human trafficking. Every instance of trafficking involves a person being trafficked from a community into a community, therefore we believe that by working together a community has the power to prevent it. As a partner of STOP THE TRAFFIK Global, we facilitate, train and support eight NI community groups, each engaging with the issue in a way suiting their locality. NO MORE TRAFFIK works alongside government and law enforcement agencies. We support the initiatives of the Dept of Justice NI Human Trafficking Action Plan outlining the priorities and objectives for the year ahead across a range of areas including the prevention of human trafficking, the protection and support of victims and bringing perpetrators to justice. We are also an active member of the Dept of Justice’s Engagement group. We recognise that human trafficking is a complex and hidden crime which exploits the most vulnerable members of society. There isn’t an easy solution but we believe that the greatest impact can be achieved when we work together. It is a key aim of NO MORE TRAFFIK to help connect and co-ordinate the work of the anti- human trafficking movement within NI, seeking to achieve this by facilitating training sessions, organising high profile events and campaigns, and through online and social media. |
