<strong>South Belfast Alternatives</strong> [Charity number: [NI100790](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-100790)]<br>The charity's objects are to promote for the public benefit and for the better preservation of public order, the provision of services directed to mediation, arbitration, conciliation or reparation in disputes and conflicts between persons, organisations or groups arising from criminal activity or interpersonal conflict. South Belfast Alternatives bases all its work upon a model of restorative practice, which it uses to alleviate the effects of low-level crime and anti-social behaviour through non-violent means. This approach involves attempting to fix the fragmented relationships that give rise to offending behaviour through support for victims, offenders, and the wider community. Victims are helped to understand why they have been on the receiving end of criminal behaviour. Offenders are encouraged to understand what has led them to become involved in criminality, and to consider the harmful consequences that their actions have upon their victim, the wider community and upon them and their families. They are encouraged to 'put things right' with those that they have harmed through restitution or making amends. In practical terms this means the delivery by the organisation of a range of practical services that include victim support, intensive youth support, family support, preventative group work, detached street work, mediation services, restorative conferencing, anti-sectarianism and anti-racism programmes, and community safety awareness schemes. SBA also works alongside the community to develop engagement and collaborative partnerships with the formal justice system in response to issues of crime and anti-social behaviour. | £73,918
