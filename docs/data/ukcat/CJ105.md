In the last year we have received funding to pilot the role of Independent Sexual Violence Advocates (ISVA). These support workers provide one to one support for victims of sexual violence throughout the criminal justice process. The outcome of our work is that victims and witnesses of crime in Northern Ireland will feel better informed about their rights, and more aware of the choices available to them, have more confidence in the Criminal Justice System, and feel that their voice is being heard and their story believed. Support offered by Victim Support NI staff and volunteers will support people to feel less anxious and safer in court. An important aspect of the organisation’s work is with decision makers to ensure they hear victims’ voices, are better informed and take account of the needs of victims and witnesses when effecting policy change.
