Throughout the year we provide funding for trips for Naíscoil/Gaelscoil. We contribute to Trócaire and other charities annually. We believe that this work shows our children to have empathy and compassion for those in societies who are less fortunate and in ill health. We are striving to inform the public within our area of the benefits of bilingualism and introducing them to the wonderful music, language and culture of the Gaels. We support the music initiative within Gaelscoil, a local musician gives lessons to the children on the tin-whistle. This experience enhances the children and allows them to learn more about our culture and the arts. We support the local Comhaltas through their weekly classes and the musicians can then show off their new talents by participating in, school assemblies, Christmas shows, Féile, Seisiún Ceoil and many private events. We are greatly supported by our committee and the general public. Without their support we would be unable to deliver new resources and classes which enhance the children in everyday learning activities and out of school activities. We are also hoping to host a summer scheme for children ages 3-11. We are currently negotiating with companies for support and donations. This would be a huge boost and would provide some mid-summer activities to children who may never get to experience summer schemes due to unemployment and low-income for families. | £2,023
