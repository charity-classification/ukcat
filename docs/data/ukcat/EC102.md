We also work with other marginalised communities across NI, and in Republic of Ireland and Scotland. Over the last 9 years we have worked to develop an innovative Human Rights Based Approach (HRBA) which is based on international socio-economic rights standards and designed to be used by marginalised people themselves. The HRBA has delivered concrete change and is tackling the root causes of social and economic inequality. The approach is a combination of: a) Organising and group development – outreach, skills and confidence building and campaign planning. b) Gathering evidence & monitoring change – support groups to collate evidence through surveys, focus groups and case studies. c) Development and monitoring of human rights indicators- support groups to engage and challenge decision makers and increase pressure for change. d) Campaign activities – coordinate campaign strategy including research, public events, media work, FOI requests and building alliances of support. e) Support participation in decision making –identify decision-making structures and develop and implement strategy and tactics to make decision making more inclusive, along with monitoring of outcomes. f) Sharing learning –website, social media, workshops & campaigning schools. The issues we have campaigned on include housing, homelessness, mental health unemployment, urban regeneration, education, domestic violence and the right to play.
