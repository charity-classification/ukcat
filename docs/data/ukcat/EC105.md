<strong>Four Towns Rural Regeneration Group</strong> [Charity number: [NI103455](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-103455)]<br>Our group strives to connect and benefit all members of the community living within the four towns area. The groups initial successful project was to gain funding to buy four defibrillators that could be fitted within each of the four villages. At present the group continues to organise functions that can be attended by all members of the four towns community building relationships and connecting people who otherwise would not engage. This includes a family fun day, table quiz and five a side football tournament. Currently the main project the group are working towards involves seeking funding to build a community hub. We in the Four Towns Community Group are striving to provide a community hub that will offer the opportunity to engage multiple generations and denominations and are confident that such a hub would be utilised by our community, connecting people from each of the four villages who otherwise may not engage. Whilst there are a number of unsuitable halls within the area there are no buildings suitable to be regularly used by all members of the community to bring everyone together. This is partially due to the size and design of each hall but also primarily due to the preconception that the residents of each village should make use of their own halls and facilities. Therefore, through the building of such a community hub which has been proposed and lead by representation from each of the four villages this preconception should be squashed. |
