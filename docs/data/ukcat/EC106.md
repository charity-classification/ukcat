<strong>Ardoyne Bone Community Health & Leisure Trust (ABC Health & Leisure Trust)</strong> [Charity number: [NI106759](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-106759)]<br>ABC Trust was established in March 2016 with the objective of addressing the problems developing on the disused school building and initiating health and leisure activities from the site. The objectives of the Trust since assuming responsibility for the site have been two-fold: 1 In the short term to lease parts of the building to local health and leisure tenants in order both to secure revenues to enable the Trust to operate and to reinforce the impression that the community’s is achievable, realistic and sustainable. 2 To secure capital funding in order to refurbish the building and deliver a modern leisure facility to a standard consistent with public and private sector providers in other parts of Belfast. In terms of Objective 1 the Trust has been successful in securing a number of tenants who are delivering visible and material leisure services to the community. These include: • The school’s Assembly Hall has been leased to a private sector fitness operator who currently provides a full-scale gymnasium with rates that meet the budgetary capabilities of the local clientele. • A number of publicly funded providers of youth leisure services who have leased rooms and facilities in the school to deliver programmes and projects. • The SIB led Urban Village team have rented office space in the school in order to deliver their services from the heart of the community. In terms of Objective 2 much work and activity is ongoing discussions with a range of capital funding bodies to try and deliver the Trust’s vision for the site. The Trust now wishes to take the project to the next level and develop a sustainable social enterprise which take forward what is an exciting and material project. We believe that this will create opportunities for jobs, training and education while preserving and enhancing a building which has been formative to many people’s experience of the area. |
