The RDCA membership elects a committee of volunteers that are heavily involved in a range of projects, from training and skills development to renewable energy and much more in between. The RDCA works with islanders and with public and voluntary agencies to improve the physical infrastructure and essential services and develop tourism and community facilities. In 2010, the Northern Ireland Executive endorsed a ‘Rathlin Policy’, recognising that the challenges faced by an island community are different from those on the mainland, and need to be addressed in a different way. The Executive supports the RDCA in its work to ensure the sustainability of island life and the promotion of a vibrant island community. Through educational and cultural programmes, study visits and an innovative Maritime Festival the RDCA looks to strengthen its regional connections with neighbours across the water in Ballycastle, the northern coast of Ireland and the Scottish islands. Through the empowerment of a community development programme, the community is increasingly aware of the opportunities to take greater responsibility for and management of its own assets. Developing local capacity though volunteering, leadership and networking strengthens the community’s intent to develop social enterprise making best use of its own resources and lowering grant dependency. This unlocks potential and increases confidence in residents, creating a more vibrant and healthy community that thrives from within, celebrates and builds on its proud traditions of cultural heritage and has an eye to the island’s future as a more sustainable home for its current population and a place of welcome and inspiration for those who come for purposes of research or recreation. | £87,213
