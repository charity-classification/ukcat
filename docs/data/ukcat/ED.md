We are now preparing for our second year and will soon be ploughing, sowing seed, and preparing for haymaking later in the year. We plan to use these facilities to bring together young and old, educate local school children, and speak to and record the experiences of the older generations, thus benefitting the whole community. In future we have aim to delve into the rich folklore and history of this area. We are planning craft demonstrations for such things as baking, blacksmithing, buttermaking patchwork, stitchwork and showing examples of old linens etc and researching the history of the local schools and country shops, linen, churches and graveyards etc. In future we would hope to be able to restore some old farm equipment etc and speak to and record wherever possible the reminiscences of the older generations of local people. Our group is run by a small number of enthusiastic men and women formed into a committee and members who share a love of local history and bygone farming practices. All of this work is carried out voluntarily and with no financial gain to the members. We intend to use our profits in the future to promote more of these projects over the next few years. We are currently linked to two Primary Schools who want to get involved with our group to carry out local history projects and we are taking part in a Christmas tree festival at a local church. We will measure the effectiveness of our work by the numbers attending our exhibitions, by the numbers of primary school children becoming involved in our activities, by ongoing evaluations and surveys and the response to our outreach programmes. There is no harm flowing from our activities. | £680
