The Foundation is a research and publishing organisation, with a strong emphasis on educational outreach and community engagement. It offers extensive knowledge on the sources available for tracing Irish and Scots-Irish ancestors, and provides opportunities for publishing objective and accessible histories of the people of Ulster, which are sold through local retailers and online, ensuring dissemination and easy availability at home and overseas. For many years the output of the Foundation was achieved through research, publications and outreach programmes. With the advent of the internet the Foundation was able to make digitised sources, including online databases of over 2 million records, more readily available to the general public and our network of contacts. Complementing this approach the Foundation is bringing its expertise to local communities through outreach and educational initiatives. It has built on community based family and history workshops to deliver a range of courses, classes, summer schools and heritage projects in partnership with voluntary organisations, community interface groups, colleges, universities, cross-community and cross-border bodies and local councils.
