<strong>Cloughfin Community Association</strong> [Charity number: [NI102972](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-102972)]<br>Cloughfin Community Association (CCA) was established in May 1987 by a group of local people to renovate and extend the local primary school which closed its door to children in June 1977. Whilst operating as a school the building had also doubled as a meeting place for local people in this socially deprived area. A committee was formed, grants sought and fund-raising took place to provide a well-equipped centre for the inhabitants of the area. Recently a grant was obtained to make the building more environmentally friendly by installing new double glazed windows, doors and a new oil burner, improving insulation and fitting curtains. Current activities which take place in the centre are a weekly Old Time Dancing Class and a weekly Irish Dancing Class. A collection of books is available for people to borrow and a table-tennis table is available for those interested in the game. With the help of funding a “Grow For Life” project has just been completed which involved the planting of 180 trees and several hundred spring bulbs, learning how to grow, cook and store herbs, vegetables and fruit, recycle vegetation to make compost, save seeds and building nest boxes and bird tables. Fundraising was carried out at Christmas for the Northern Ireland Chest, Heart & Stroke Association. We have just received the news that we are being granted funding to hold a series of health talks through Building the Community Pharmacy Partnership and are currently waiting to hear if we have been successful. CCA is a member of Omagh Forum for Rural Associations and we refer people, when the need arises, in the Cloughfin and surrounding area to the MARA officer who is based at the Forum. | £9,589
