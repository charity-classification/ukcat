<strong>The Friends of St John The Baptist Primary School</strong> [Charity number: [NI107470](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-107470)]<br>The Friends of St John The Baptist Primary School (FSJB) is run by parents of the school. Its main aim is to fundraise for the school by organising a series of fun events for children and parents. Fundraising is increasingly important as the school’s budget has been significantly decreased over recent years. The FSJB fundraises through a series of events in the school calendar. Without everyone doing a little bit the FSJB wouldn’t be able to put on these events and raise so much extra money for the benefit of all our children. Every parent in the school is automatically part of the FSJB and can get in touch if they would like to help in any way. Volunteers bring with them a range of skills and experience that can enhance the learning opportunities of pupils and bring new ideas and fundraising suggestions to further increase the school funds. Our volunteers can include: members of the governing body, parents/relatives of pupils and teaching staff. Any items bought for any FSJB event by a volunteer, that have been agreed in advance with a FSJB committee member, will be reimbursed by the FSJB committee once a receipt/proof of purchase has been received. Volunteers are covered by the Parentkind membership Insurance Policy. |
