As an organisation we are very much aware of our role within the community, offering targeted youth provision which helps to develop the young people involved from a personal, social and educational viewpoint whilst also impacting upon the local Ardoyne community as a whole through the reduction of criminal activity, substance abuse and improving relations amongst young people and also between young people and other groups within the community. In particular the Centre develops means of engaging young people through programmes which they can not only participate in but also help to design and deliver. Our programmes and activities are responsive to and reflective of the needs of the young people in the Ardoyne and wider area which we serve, and are strategically designed to correspond with the curriculum for youth provision. Thus, we feel that this approach fosters a greater sense of engagement and buy in from young people which ultimately ensures that the project has a much greater impact in improving the quality of life that they experience. The above benefits will be evidenced through a number of evaluative means including: recordings and observations of staff members; other qualitative data from parents, teachers, and community representatives; quantitative data from programme and project evaluations; data from other sources including other service providers both statutory and non-statutory. | £356,782
