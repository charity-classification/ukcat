In particular the Centre develops means of engaging young people through programmes which they can not only participate in but also help to design and deliver. Our programmes and activities are responsive to and reflective of the needs of the young people in the Ardoyne and wider area which we serve, and are strategically designed to correspond with the curriculum for youth provision.
