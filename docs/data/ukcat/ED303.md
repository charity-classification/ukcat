The young people have the opportunity to engage with young people from other communities, cultures, religions and ethnicities both here and in India, forming deep and lasting friendships. These encounters are transformative, developing the young people as local and global citizens and stimulating them to greater engagement with the wider community in Northern Ireland and globally. The year-long programme includes workshops, residential weekends, team fundraising and culminates in 16 day trip to India. Here the young people engage with their Indian peers from very disadvantaged communities, teaching English and learning about Indian culture. Learning is in both directions, the NI young people discovering that they have as much to learn from the Indian young people as they do from them.
