We will also be running computer classes for those unfamiliar with IT.

We run events and activities which relate to the heritage and culture of the area, particularly in relation to music and poetry, keeping local customs alive. We collect and document local history and run projects and programmes which promote understanding and respect for the different traditions in the town. | £158,041
