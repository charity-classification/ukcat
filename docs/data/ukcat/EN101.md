<strong>THE JEAN ELIZABETH ANN MORROW TRUST</strong> [Charity number: [NI101436](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-101436)]<br>The purpose is to physically restore coral reef ecosystems in developing countries, particularly S.E. Asia. Coral reefs are degraded by destructive fishing practices and, due to global warming, more frequent bleaching events caused by extended periods of hot weather. Natural regeneration may not be possible or may take many years, but by establishing coral garden nurseries, coral transplants and the deployment of artificial structures as a substrate for coral recruitment, the period for coral restoration can be substantially reduced. Educate local children regarding the importance of coral reefs in protecting the adjacent coastline, providing a protective nursery for many fish populations and creating a habitat for a large number of interdependent species. The purpose is to re-establish a viable, self-sustaining and breeding population of White Tailed Sea Eagles in the north west of Ireland, after an absence of 110 years. In association with the National Parks and Wildlife Service, we propose to implement a White Tailed Sea Eagle Reintroduction Project in Ards Forest Park in north Donegal. It is proposed that educational programmes and trips for primary school children would be arranged to raise awareness of, and the need for, the protection of wildlife. Interest in these top predators will be stimulated from further afield by establishing a website to show images of nesting birds from remote cameras, and monitoring their movements with radio transmitters fitted to each bird. | £932
