Over the past 20 years the Association has delivered a very wide range of projects that have turned around the fortunes of a dispersed rural community that has been suffering from depopulation and a decline in agricultural employment. The Carntogher area has successfully halted this cycle of decline and is in the process of building a new future and is now helping other communities and individuals to follow its example and fulfil their potential. The Association promotes a wide range of initiatives including, formal and informal training, family support, health & wellbeing, peace and reconciliation, social housing, youth initiatives, Irish-language and cultural initiatives, an arts programme, environmental projects and social economy enterprises such as Siopa An Carn, Carn Translations and Spraoi CIC. The Association has administered well over £3M of funding in the past eight years and has much experience in project delivery and grant administration. Recent capital investment in the group infrastructures has seen the creation of An Carn Conference Centre, An Coire Arts Centre and An Teach Glas – Self Catering Accommodation. In addition to this an opportunity arose in early 2012 to secure the purchase of 130 acres of very valuable ecological habitat directly alongside 80 acres of Drumnaph Woodland which the Association co-managed with the Woodland Trust. As a result of funding from HLF and NIEA the Association was able to purchase the land and is now the only community-owned Nature Reserve in N.Ireland. The Association has undertaken some basic improvement and access works and offered interpretation via a brochure, website and App. Many other communities from across Ireland and further afield are now looking to Carntogher as a model of good practice in building sustainable and prosperous rural communities. | £483,378
