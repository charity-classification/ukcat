<strong>Sole Purpose</strong> [Charity number: [NI100618](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-100618)]<br>Sole Purpose is a professional theatre company based in Derry Londonderry. We have been creating high quality, innovative theatre on social and public issues since 1997 and have toured throughout Ireland and the UK, and have taken productions to the USA. We produce new work for theatre and non-theatre venues, working in partnership with statutory and voluntary organisations to bring professional theatre to working class and marginalised communities, as well as touring theatres. Our repertoire includes plays which look at issues of elder abuse, domestic violence, the ethnic minority experience in Northern Ireland, underage drinking, issues affecting the LGBT community, mental health and other subjects. We also run drama related workshops and writing workshops for people from all walks of life, to encourage creativity, build confidence and equip people with skills enabling them to pursue careers. Our work takes place in community centres, care homes, hospitals, schools, colleges, women's aid centres, prisons and theatres. The people who benefit from our work are diverse. The many productions that we have developed target different audiences – young people, parents, teachers, carers, women, ethnic minority groups, refugees, older people, nurses, social workers, LGBT people, community workers and the mainstream audience. Our most recent play, ‘Blinkered’ by Patricia Byrne, which explores issues of suicide and mental health, has been touring schools and colleges since 2016. It has helped numerous young people to tackle their own personal mental health issues. In 2019 Sole Purpose won the Special Jury Prize at Origin Theatre’s 1st Irish Festival in New York for bringing theatre on difficult social issues to non theatre spaces.
