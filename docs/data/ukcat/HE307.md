<strong>Rosie's Trust</strong> [Charity number: [NI102422](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-102422)]<br>Our objective is to alleviate the stresses and anxieties experienced by animal owners who find themselves no longer able to care for their companion pets in a practical way. Individuals who are terminally ill, older people and those who are suffering the side effects of a -cute cancer treatment often find themselves simply too weak or frail to carry out the basic tasks needed to ensure the welfare and happiness of their pet is maintained. This can cause considerable stress and distress for both the owner and their pet. These circumstances can lead to the owner having to eventually ‘give up’ the pet and in so doing experience a tremendous loss and feeling of guilt – which can only add to their already difficult life changing circumstances. Rosie’s Trust will work in partnership with our beneficiaries. Our volunteers will carry out the practical tasks such as dog walking, vet visits, cat care – thus aiming to keep the owner and animal together for as long as is practical. In addition to the practical issues for the animals our volunteers will also be building a relationship with the owner and having daily or frequent interaction, thus providing another social interaction for the owner as well. Our volunteers will be trained to identify ‘signposting’ opportunities to other agencies - if appropriate - which may be of use to the owner in other areas. We will be recruiting a network of volunteers who will offer ‘foster homes’ for pet’s whose owners need to temporarily go to hospices or hospitals. We will also seek to assist in the longer term re homing for the pets – when the owner is no longer with us. | £302,873
