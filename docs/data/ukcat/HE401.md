<strong>Larne Music Festival</strong> [Charity number: [NI107267](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-107267)]<br>Larne Music Festival is held annually to promote the study and cultivation of music. Preparing for and performing at Larne Music Festival involves young people in group activity and individual achievement across a range of musical instruments. They gain a deeper appreciation of their repertoire and of the work and performance of others. Each performance receives an adjudication from an expert in the genre entered. The inspiration gained from skilled adjudicators raises standards of amateur musicianship locally. Today’s Festival has moved a long way from its beginnings in 1925, and its revival in 1999, but the ethos remains the same: to promote and encourage young people to participate in music. Our Festival is aimed at children and young people and is tailored to encourage all entrants, from the rawest beginner, to the student about to step into the higher echelons of their musical studies. All are treated with respect, are put at ease, and benefit greatly from the comments made by our expert and sensitive Adjudicators. Larne Music Festival will be held from 3rd - 6th April 2019 with categories in: Strings; Brass; Woodwind; Traditional; Vocal; Guitar and Pianoforte. Each year the festival is rounded off by a Charity Concert with all proceeds being donated to the NI Hospice (2017) and Larne Food Bank (2018) in recent years. | £130
