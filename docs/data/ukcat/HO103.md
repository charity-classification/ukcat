This brings us together as a diverse people, it's a way to meet friends for the youth and a way to get together positively. From time to time we would also have events in which the youth would sing for us or perform a short drama or a dance, this too is a form of entertainment, it's open to anyone and is completely free. Times such as Christmas, we would go in the streets to share some gifts to the less fortunate, we would also open the building to let them come in the heat, eat some food and rest and feel like a family. We would bring clothes and shoes from the house and share amongst ourself. On Sundays we would gather together and share the word of God. The idea of this charity is to build a diverse family, share and spend time together all in the name of God, no matter where you're from what background you have or what you do, we all help one another. We have a few leaders who help make all of this possible. | £7,023
