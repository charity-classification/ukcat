The Museum is an educational and tourist facility which examines and commemorates Ireland’s contribution to World War One through the actions of the 10th and 16th (Irish) Divisions and the 36th (Ulster) Division. The Museum has various displays and exhibitions and operates organised guided tours. The Museum has increasingly focused on the community relations potential of our shared history as a vehicle to further cross-community understanding and reconciliation. The Museum includes a shop selling books and memorabilia, and a cafe, which is available to the casual visitor and organisations for planned events. • Education & Outreach is essential to the Somme Association. We deliver numerous outreach sessions to all ages and continue to strive to enable participation of groups with special needs. There is a growing demand for this facility and this increases the profile of our work. • The Somme Association has a leading role in a number of commemoration events in France and Belgium. The main event takes place each year on the 1st July at the Ulster Memorial Tower in Thiepval in France, N.I.’s principal War Memorial to those who sacrificed their lives in the First World War. • The Ulster Tower, in France, attracts visitors to view the Memorial Room on the ground floor.
