<strong>The Council Of The Northern Ireland War Memorial (Incorporated)</strong> [Charity number: [NI103635](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-103635)]<br>The Northern Ireland War Memorial is a fully accredited museum situated in the heart of the Cathedral Quarter, beside Belfast Cathedral and the MAC. It welcomes visitors and tourists from all around the world. The Home Front exhibition is a ‘must see’ for anybody with an interest in Northern Ireland’s role in World War Two. The exhibition recalls the Belfast blitz of 1941 and the presence of US forces from 1942 to 1944. A bronze sculpture depicts half lifesize figures of a mother guiding her child through the ruins of Belfast on the morning after the blitz of 15 April 1941. Soldiers' artefacts are also on display alongside mannequins dressed in uniforms, medals, propaganda posters and pieces of anti-aircraft shells. The most evocative exhibit, however, is a screen that scrolls each of the names of the 1,000 men, women and children who died during the blitz. The gallery is open Monday to Friday and admission is free. The museum has in recent years built a reputation for staging themed wartime weekend Living History events. These have included a Dig for Victory weekend organized as part of the European Heritage Open Day initiative. The War Memorial gallery temporarily housed a selection of small farm animals and two costumed Land Girls. Wartime carrot cake was on offer, as were tips on how to grow a Victory Garden, as per 1940s instructions. Sing and dance for victory events held by the War Memorial have also proved extremely popular on Culture Night in the Cathedral Quarter. The Education Officer runs a comprehensive primary schools programme based on life in Northern Ireland during World War Two. Various hands-on learning activities are available and visits can be tailored to meet special needs and interests. Children can expect a fact-filled session with a chance to hold an incendiary bomb, see a baby’s gas mask close up, inspect the weekly food rations, and try on some real wartime uniforms and helmets. | £173,438
