Through the voluntary efforts of members and other members of the community this building has been transformed into highly functional facilities with a large social area, wood-working/turning workshop, kitchen, meeting room and office. Although upgrade work continues, the building and organisation have been functional since about April 2018 such that we could attract more members and contribute to meeting our stated purpose. The latest addition in 2019 is a poly-tunnel behind the main building. The building is currently open 3 days/week (Tues, Wed, Thurs) 10:00-14:00hrs and Wed 19:00 - 22:00hrs. The most important aspect of our activities is the provision of a warm, safe and pleasant environment for members and guests to visit and use, whether they wish to be involved in woodworking, gardening, playing pool and other games, using our free library or simply sitting down for coffee and a chat. Other activities includes a "walking group" (Tuesdays am) comprising members, partners and occasional visitors. In the Shed, on a regular basis during the autumn and winter, a series of free public talks are organised covering a wide range of subjects e.g. alcohol dependency, scam awareness, mental & physical health, home security, mindfulness, fire safety, historical topics and presentations from a number of local and national charities. Significant numbers from across the community attend. Various social events are held in the Shed e.g. Xmas party, treasure hunt, barbecue.
