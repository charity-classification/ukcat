We initially held open meetings with all interested parties and organisations, gaining support from all. We have worked in partnership with NIEA, Belfast Hills, the Woodland Trust, Ulster Wildlife Trust,Ulster Angling Federation, several angling groups and clubs, community groups and local politicians, and Lagan Valley Regional Park. We have trained and equipped two groups of volunteers in invertebrate sampling techniques and recording, the results of which are shared with NIEA and on a national database. This scheme gives monthly results which helps to monitor the health of the river. It also gives a focus of interest and education to the broader community. Through this program we have identified several pollution sources, and helped to stop them. We have conducted surveys and sampling in inaccessible areas of the river by canoe, highlighting pollution and invasive species. We have attended the Water Framework meetings on a regular basis, to discuss and work with stakeholders. We have undertaken several river and bank clean-up days with various partner groups. We have given advice and help to several angling groups on starting up clubs, with the intention of them taking care of their part of the river. We have taken over custodianship of a community woodland, with river bank access, with a view to a river improvement project in partnership with the community and council. We have negotiated a lease for water rights on a section of the Lagan with a view to a large scale improvement project, and also to give us some river rights in law. This helps us to fight pollution. We have had discussions with the Farmers Union and landowners on how to reduce agricultural pollution. Two trustees are currently applying for AccessNI clearance to put programs into community summer schemes to include canoeing, fishing instruction, and the environment. |
