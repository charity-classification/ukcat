<strong>Our Lady of Bethlehem Abbey Trust</strong> [Charity number: [NI105693](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-105693)]<br>The Cistercian monks of Our Lady of Bethlehem Abbey lead a monastic way of life in solitude and silence, in prayer and penitence as defined in the Constitutions. They seek God and follow Christ under a rule and an abbot in a stable community sharing everything in common. The community celebrate two Masses each day. These are attended by the public, some of whom have an active role in the celebration (Mass Servers, Readers, Ministers of the Eucharist). On occasions we do provide cover for local parish priests. Currently confessions are heard by the priests of the community six days each week. There is a special Confessional Chapel for this which is always open to the public. On all days, even outside of the normal hours, people can go to Reception and ask to see a priest for confession should none be on duty. In our Guesthouse at least one member of the community is on duty seven days a week. Visitors can simply walk in and ask to speak to a monk. While the hearing of confessions is certainly part of the work in the Guesthouse, it forms only the smaller part of it. The visitors who come do so for mostly pastoral reasons: to talk about their personal or family problems or to ask for prayers, blessings etc. The vast majority seek an attentive and compassionate ear - someone who will listen to them in confidence. It is a unique, free service, and open-to-all. Our Guesthouse is also residential. Anyone of good will who is over eighteen can come and avail of our hospitality. Generally, all who come do so for some spiritual purpose. The Guesthouse also hosts groups, again usually of a religious nature. Its conference room is used by the public at least once a week. We take part in an annual Heritage Open Day when guided tours of the whole monastery are offered to individuals or public groups. | £1,120,861
