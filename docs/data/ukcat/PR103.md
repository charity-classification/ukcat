<strong>Life and Time</strong> [Charity number: [NI106965](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-106965)]<br>Home is the preferred place of death for 68% of people in the UK but this is not always achievable. Often the patient’s symptoms require Hospice or Hospital care or there may not be sufficient community provision to manage symptoms in their own home and the 68% manifests as 20.8% of people. (Source: 2008-2010 data from Office for National Statistics (ONS) for England & Wales, General Register Office of Scotland (GRO) and the Northern Ireland Statistics & Research Agency (NISRA)). Our service will support patients and their families at home during the end of life stage, through an on-call rota of appropriately trained palliative Nurses and Doctors (residing in the local community) who can rapidly respond to provide patients with a similar level of symptom control and support that is offered to patients in a hospice or hospital setting at end of life. It is recognised by ‘Life & Time’ that the District Nurse is the key professional in the care of patients in their own home in regards to coordination of End of Life Care (EOLC) and it is hoped through engagement with the local Trust that the referral process to ‘Life & Time’ can be facilitated by District Nursing Teams in the proposed catchment area. ‘Life & Time’ nurses and doctors living locally would be available to provide an additional service at night time to respond to patient’s EOLC needs, for example administration of anticipatory prescribed medicines (which should already be available in their own home), assist with change in position of patient, or to give confidence to the family at night time. A local community based palliative service model would enable a response time of 30 minutes or less to be achievable. | £258,150
