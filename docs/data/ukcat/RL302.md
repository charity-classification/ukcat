Our primary goal is to partner with churches to pioneer, train & empower leadership to implement sustainable grass roots community development initiatives. In order to fulfill this vision, we have a strategic partnership relationship with the international missionary organisation, One Mission Society. At the beginning our partnership was focused on the impoverished country of Mozambique, though during 2014, a new partnership was formed in support of work in Mexico. We will from time-to-time partner with other non profit organisations to provide specialist resources and training. Our vision is to develop community development projects that will empower locals without creating dependence. Poverty, lack of education, poor health awareness, lack of clean drinking water, AIDS, disease and illiteracy cripple many communities. As Christians, we cannot ignore these gripping needs. We believe that local churches can play a central role in bringing about positive change but they are hindered to do so because there is a lack of training and appropriate resources. We desire to support church groups and help establish new ones. | £43,755
