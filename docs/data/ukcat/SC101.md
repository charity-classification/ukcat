<strong>Newington Day Centre</strong> [Charity number: [NI101567](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-101567)]<br>Newington Day Centre has been providing care to people who are older and at times quite vulnerable for over 30 years, it has three strands to its service. We provide a range of services to our members who are supported by our Volunteer Project and together we provide respite to our carers. It is difficult to separate the three, as they go hand in hand to provide an inclusive, community approach to care of older people. This unique community Day Centre values older people, respects their opinions and includes them in the operation of the Centre, in fact, almost half of the Management Committee are over the age of sixty. The Centre opens each weekday from Monday to Friday 9.30am to 4.00pm. The only exception is Monday morning when we do not open until 11.30am as this time is set aside for staff, carer and volunteer training. There are approximately 50 people attending the Centre each day. Some of our more vulnerable members require assistance with personal care, assistance with feeding, provision of a nutritious meal, hairdressing and hand and chiropody care. It is important that the provision of personal hygiene service and good physical care is accessible and flexible to all older people within the community. Whilst practical care is important for the physical care of our members a range of activities and social events is equally as important for good mental health and stimulation. Activities, outings and social inclusion can help promote a positive approach to older age. We aim to help people who are older to remain active, independent and living in their own home. We aim to achieve this by increasing self-esteem, encouraging members to make decisions affecting themselves and giving a platform, through consultation and focus groups, to express their wishes. The Management and staff aim to provide our members with the best quality of care possible, thus improving their overall quality of life. We want our members to enjoy their time at the Centre. | £381,195
