They receive support to allow their attendance at school, and colleges for the older children. There are a considerable number of monthly and annual donations to directly support education for the orphans, supplemented by income from events. Specific donations have also been made through the charity for projects such as the Graeme McDowell First Aid Centre at the orphanage. The money donated through Willies Orphan Fund is channelled through the Duang Prateep Foundation and goes directly to the orphanage at Baan Tham Namchai. There is regular contact between the orphanage children and staff in Thailand, with Willies Orphan Fund, charting the progress of the children involved.
