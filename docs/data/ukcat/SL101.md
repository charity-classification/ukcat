<strong>Military and Police Support of West Tyrone</strong> [Charity number: [NI101346](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-101346)]<br>The best tool we have is being there for drop ins which allows our people to open up and discuss their difficulties. From this we do whatever is needed should it be financial advice or medical / emotional support. With a trained welfare advice volunteer we give low level advice and support and where necessary signpost to other partners. For instance, when a member, because of their background and location, felt unable to apply for necessary benefits or seek employment. The results of such work is obvious in relieving poverty and wellbeing of those beneficiaries. With trained volunteer befrienders we provide a structured emotional support mechanism for those living alone, in social isolation, dealing with medical issues, dealing with terminal illness and bereavement. The structure of this confidential service means full records are kept and the service is externally supervised. In all aspects we work to bring people to a better place to help them as they may strive, via others, to gain justice. We are there for them in their dark days and to help them on the journey to peace and reconciliation by engaging with other groups and other communities. Volunteers with ‘listening ear’ training can give the necessary support to those who are on the first rungs of the steps of addressing their mental needs. Most are in need of someone there when necessary rather than in depth psychological interventions. To make people adaptable to society we provide and encourage people to take part in educational courses that will assist their journey to recovery eg mental health awareness and simple computer courses. Other courses dealing with life skills and crafts are also available. In cases these are enough to assist to make the beneficiaries more acceptable to employment. It also encourages people to become more involved in the voluntary and community sector. | £95,200
