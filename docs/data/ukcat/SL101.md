Our work involves pastoral care of the general public. In this we both demonstrate the intrinsic Christian value of loving our neighbour without prejudice and raise awareness of the relevance of faith today. We care, listen and help as small teams of trained Street Pastors. We patrol at night clubs between 11.30pm and 4am on Saturdays; we help vulnerable people get home safely; we provide water, flip-flops & foil bodywarmers as needed, and defuse fights. We also foster community safety by doing patrols in estates, town centres and parks on Friday nights between 7.30pm and 10.30pm and at contentious football matches. We work with Police and NIHE to establish current hotspots and issues. Street Pastors wear uniform, distinguished by the Street Pastor logo. This elicits questions from people who ask about our Christian beliefs. When asked to, we share our belief in Jesus Christ and His love for all mankind and pray with individuals as requested. This advances the Christian faith for the benefit of the public. Community Capacity Building As Street Pastors our work involves liaising with police in order to address issues of socially disadvantaged groups or marginalized persons in the community. We try to uphold best practice in all our services for public benefit. As Christians, members of local churches, our work demonstrates the compassion of Jesus Christ in practical ways within the life of our community. We show the relevance of church and faith, to life and society by building the capacity and skills of our Street Pastors as non-judgmental and non-discriminatory agents of peace, reconciliation and safety in our community.
