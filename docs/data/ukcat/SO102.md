The conflicts could be at any level from local to national, regional and global. They could also be of varying degrees of intensity, ranging and complexity, from a relatively simple case of disagreements between two groups, to conflicts that involve multiple groups and dimensions. The development of an inclusive knowledge base calls for a fully integrated program to be taught which will cover all those who are affected directly or indirectly by a specific conflict. The programs taught will deliver conceptual innovations that will build on the latest developments in the conceptualisation of conflicts from across the world. The programs taught will achieve its objectives by being sensitive to the interface between the understanding of individual conflicts and the larger conceptualisation of conflict. It will aim to build an inclusive knowledge base and then disseminate that knowledge in a way that influences both popular perceptions and policies aimed at conflict resolution. The knowledge delivery will be carried out through short-term courses on conflict resolution, targeted at all who may have to deal with social conflicts, whether in industry, government or civil society. ICS&RS will achieve its purposes by the delivery of well-planned and integrated short courses, targeted to impart education and create awareness and public benefit. In furthering the purposes, it will co-operate with other charities & voluntary bodies to establish support.
