<strong>YOUTH WITH A MISSION (NORTHERN IRELAND) LIMITED</strong> [Charity number: [NI101261](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-101261)]<br>Each year we train up to 50 young people per year in 6 month training courses which provide quality training on the basics of the Christian faith as well as giving these trainees the opportunity to put what they have learned into practice. In addition we influence hundreds more by holding a weekly inter-denominational worship and teaching event. In addition to our 6 month-long courses and our weekly evening events we hold a number of weekend and week-long seminars for people to come and learn from our trainers. We build community by using our premises in Rostrevor to host monthly community fairs, concerts, weekly Parent and Toddlers mornings, weekly sewing groups for local women, and annual holiday Bible weeks for children aged 5-11. Our staff also engage in weekly detached youth work with teenagers, as well as offering our expertise to local youth groups in their centre-based youth work. We bridge sectarian divides by running a weekly inter-denominational Christian worship service that is attended by Protestants from many denominations and by Catholics, and by those at times with no faith commitment. We also run week long seminars that provide training on how to be an agent for reconciliation in places of conflict. This seminar is something we run in Northern Ireland but we also run it in Bosnia. Further we are involved in taking young Northern Irish people from a cross community background on njourney of understanding" trips to nations with a history of conflict like Israel and Palestine, Bosnia, Uganda, Rwanda, South Africa. These trips prove to catalyse young people to be agents of mutual understanding and conflict resolution in their own communities. We see this as an inherent part of the Christian faith. | £213,596
