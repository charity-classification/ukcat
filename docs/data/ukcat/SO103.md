Its overall aim is to give citizens both an overview of, and an insight into, the underlying causes of the conflict, better equipping them to play an active role in peace building and so helping to foster a culture of Justice and Human Rights for all. The project has seven objectives within the Open College Network national system of accreditation. These are: 1. To promote an understanding of participative democracy to better able victims and survivors to deal with the past in their own terms 2. To develop a sense of active citizenship based on human rights and justice for all 3. To underscore the view of democracy as a conflict resolving process 4. To build awareness and understanding of the differences within and between the various perspectives that have been in conflict 5. To underscore the contested nature of History and its role in shaping perception 6. To explore the circumstances that fractured civil society to the point where citizens adopted a ‘war’ as opposed to a ‘peace’ orientation to resolving conflict 7. To manage and facilitate collective processes that enable public acknowledgment in the furtherance of broadening and deepening societal understanding of conflict and transforming fractured relationships Drawing on the experience of their programme Epilogues, Gaslight Media Trust have, since 2012, been in the process of developing a new multimedia workshop based education programme called JustUs.
