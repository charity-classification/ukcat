Our Polish Saturday School organized and run by the Polish Association in Bangor benefits Polish children giving them a chance to learn polish language, history and polish tradition while leaving abroad. However, apart from teaching polish language at PS school we are working hard to integrate polish children with the local community. As an example Polish children took part in celebration of the commemoration service in memory of soldiers who lost their lives during the WW2. After the ceremony we have been invited to the parish hall for refreshment where we could meet local people and representative of local authorities to discuss the involvement of polish pilots during the war in the region.
