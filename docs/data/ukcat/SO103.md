Since that time and continuing today the programme is delivered to adults in educational institutions and community based organisations. Its overall aim is to give citizens both an overview of, and an insight into, the underlying causes of the conflict, better equipping them to play an active role in peace building and so helping to foster a culture of Justice and Human Rights for all. The project has seven objectives within the Open College Network national system of accreditation. These are: 1. To promote an understanding of participative democracy to better able victims and survivors to deal with the past in their own terms 2. To develop a sense of active citizenship based on human rights and justice for all 3. To underscore the view of democracy as a conflict resolving process 4. To build awareness and understanding of the differences within and between the various perspectives that have been in conflict 5. To underscore the contested nature of History and its role in shaping perception 6. To explore the circumstances that fractured civil society to the point where citizens adopted a ‘war’ as opposed to a ‘peace’ orientation to resolving conflict 7. To manage and facilitate collective processes that enable public acknowledgment in the furtherance of broadening and deepening societal understanding of conflict and transforming fractured relationships Drawing on the experience of their programme Epilogues, Gaslight Media Trust have, since 2012, been in the process of developing a new multimedia workshop based education programme called JustUs. The estimated completion date for the development of the programme will be late 2015.

We dedicate our activities mainly into education, integration, democracy, tolerance and human rights in particular human rights for ethnic minorities. Our Polish Saturday School organized and run by the Polish Association in Bangor benefits Polish children giving them a chance to learn polish language, history and polish tradition while leaving abroad. However, apart from teaching polish language at PS school we are working hard to integrate polish children with the local community. As an example Polish children took part in celebration of the commemoration service in memory of soldiers who lost their lives during the WW2. After the ceremony we have been invited to the parish hall for refreshment where we could meet local people and representative of local authorities to discuss the involvement of polish pilots during the war in the region. This is one example of our integration activities which the local community clearly benefits from. Every year in December our Polish Association organize a Christmas Festival event open to general public where we present polish culture, food and tradition related to celebration of the Christmas time back home. And every year this event gets bigger and better with a wide verity of people coming from a spectrum of local communities and local authorities to celebrate together with us and to integrate. We have people of many nationalities, different religions, backgrounds, material and social status, age, sex and colour of skin. We find our events to be very beneficial for the local communities in a process of community integration via learning of each other custom and playing together. | £16,657
