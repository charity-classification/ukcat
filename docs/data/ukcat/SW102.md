<strong>Sister Anna Chaplaincy Charitable Trust</strong> [Charity number: [NI107366](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-107366)]<br>From the beginning of the chaplaincy programme in Lagan College the work of the chaplains has fallen into three broad areas: pastoral care of students; nurturing the spiritual life of the College and the care-taking and cultivating of the school's Christian integrated ethos. There are a number of ways in which this is done. Pastoral care is provided by a drop in facility during break and lunchtimes where students can raise issues that concern them, receive advice and encouragement or share ideas. A collection of reading materials has been built up and is on display for students. Books and magazines on topics such as bereavement, stress management, understanding world religions, the Troubles and Integrated Education are available to students. One-to-one appointments can be arranged with students and staff to talk, pray or just find some space. The reasons for which students and staff come are varied but one of the most important ways in which support is provided is during times of bereavement. Mediation to resolve conflicts between students is available to empower the students to resolve their own conflicts. The planning and coordination of worship and assemblies remains central to our work. These include special assemblies at Christmas, Harvest, Easter and other important times of the year. Prayer and reflection occurs throughout the year and the participation of all who come to our services deeply affirms our relationships across different traditions. We cooperate with the RE Department of the school to facilitate church visits to different denominations. Our relationships with local church communities provide a valuable opportunity for dialogue and exchange around the issue of spirituality in education. The care-taking and cultivating of the school's Christian integrated ethos is central to build genuine friendships regardless of cultural, religious or political backgrounds. This is done by facilitating workshops with students, seminars and programmes. |
