CRG also operates a community transport scheme with one 17 seater minibus which was original funded by BIG Lottery through the Village SOS programme. This scheme is primarily used by children. It serves the local primary school in the morning and again at 2pm and 3pm every school day. We are members of CTANI. In the evening and weekends the bus is used to get beneficiaries to and from Clonmore Hall. We also apply for event funding primarily through local council for community events. For example, we have just received funding from ACBC Council to run an information day for residents to welcome them to the new council as Clonmore was previously located in the Dungannon Council area. This event will bring residents, councilors and council officers together for an evening in Clonmore Hall ensuring that residents know who their representatives are in local government, what local government is now responsible for and how to contact them.
