<strong>Ulster Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (USPCA)</strong> [Charity number: [NI102755](https://findthatcharity.uk/orgid/GB-NIC-102755)]<br>The Ulster Society Prevention Cruelty to Animals (USPCA) is the second oldest Animal Welfare Charity in the world founded in 1836. USPCA is supported entirely by voluntary donations. The USPCA’s business model changed dramatically on the 1st April 2012 as a result of the implementation of the new Welfare of Animals Act (NI) which placed a statutory responsibility on Local Authorities to improve welfare standards and afford better protection from neglect, abuse and exploitation for companion animals and livestock. In response the USPCA has moved away from traditional animal recovery and sheltering practices to the provision of an Animal Hospital for the ‘Relief of Suffering’ and associated charitable services. The Hospital treats many injured animals that would otherwise remain untreated and in distress. It also ensures that essential veterinary care is available for companion animals where the pet owners’ financial circumstances are an obstacle to their animal’s wellbeing. Outreach from the Animal Hospital, to provide these services to those in need across Northern Ireland, is achieved through a voucher scheme for local Vets. In partnership with the Trussell Trust and other organisations, who operate food banks across Northern Ireland, the USPCA provides food parcels for the many companion animals belonging to individuals and families in need, thereby supporting the animals’ welfare and ensuring their continued companionship for the owners. The USPCA also investigates and exposes animal cruelty such as organised dog fighting, badger baiting, carted deer hunts or cock fighting. Through its education programmes for schools and community associations the USPCA promotes responsible pet care and instils an appreciation for our native wildlife. | £3,314,663
